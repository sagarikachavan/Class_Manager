Class Manager app
INTRODUCTION
During these tough times, especially in the midst of a pandemic such as this, 
there is a growing need for online applications for almost all our needs, 
academics being one of them. Having an application to view all your college 
assignments, announcements and timetable will definitely be of great help.
The Estudio app is a brilliant application which is useful to both students 
and teachers. The teachers/class representative can add, update and modify 
the time tables, announcements, assignments, information about teachers by 
creating a class code for the students with great ease. The students can login 
using the class code and view all the information.

Project Description
Estudio is an organizer app that lets the admin create data and the users read 
them. The class representative/ teacher logs in to the app using their 
credentials (Create account as Teacher if not registered). Once they log in, 
they can enter an already existing class or can create a class proving the class 
name.
Once they create / enter a class, they are given the class code which they are 
free to share with their students. The students login to the app using their 
credentials(Create account as Student if not registered ). Once they login, 
they are asked to enter the class code provided by their teacher/ 
representative. On the entering the code, are directed to the welcome page 
where they can access the information they choose. Information regarding 
their Assignments, Teachers (Staff), Announcements, Timetable.
The admin (teacher / representative) can logout whenever they wish to.
The interface is very convenient, comprehendible and friendly.
We have used Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase FireStore and Firebase 
Authentication for the backend of this app. Firebase Authentication is used 
to store the login ID with the hashed passwords. Firestore is used to store the 
login/ account details like isTeacher/isStudent , the accounts’ current class 
code etc. Realtime DB for storing information regarding Assignments, 
Teachers and Timetable. Any data can in the DB can be modified only by 
the admin (teachers).
Since our app uses Firebase as the backend, the app requires internet to 
function.

CONCLUSION
Our App “Estudio” is extremely easy to navigate and incredibly userfriendly. All the important information is very conveniently placed, allowing 
the user to navigate very intuitively.
Class Manager uses the multi-user concept where student and teacher are 
different types of user and have different functionalities.
You can keep track of teachers, timetable, and assignments. You can also get 
notifications about when assignments and exams are due.
Therefore, helps Students to keep track of their school or college work.

FUTURE SCOPE

• Adding a navigation layout for the user to easily navigate between 
different activities.
• Let teachers set a submission date, considering other assignments’
dates.
• We would add a few more functionalities and activity layout like 
Results, Materials and links to study from, etc.
• Send a pop-up notification on addition of an announcement to a class.
• Add ‘Forgot Password?’ feature.
• Notify the students a day before the submission of an assignment.
